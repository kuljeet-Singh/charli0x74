# Building Instructions for Charliplex LED
## Introduction
The IS31FL3731 will let you get back to that classic LED matrix look, with a nice upgrade! This I2C LED driver chip has
the ability to PWM each individual LED in a 16x9 grid so you can have beautiful LED lighting effects, without a lot of
pin twiddling. Simply tell the chip which LED on the grid you want lit, and what brightness and it's all taken care of for
you. <br>

The IS31FL3731 is a nice little chip - it can use 2.7-5.5V power and logic so its flexible for use with any microcontroller.
You can set the address so up to 4 matrices can share an I2C bus. Inside is enough RAM for 8 separate frames of
display memory so you can set up multiple frames of an animation and flip them to be displayed with a single
command.

## Components Required


## Budget
Approximate budget required for this project is $250. Bills can be seen [here](https://github.com/kuljeet-Singh/charli0x74/tree/master/Documents/INVOICES). Since all these sensors( or effectors)were ordered in gorups,we saved a good amount of money. If you are alone working on this project you should be ready to spend more money!

## Time Commitment
THis project can be completed in 3 days.(Required all parts and neccessary tools are already in hand)
