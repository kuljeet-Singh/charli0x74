# Building Instructions for Charliplex LED
## Introduction
The IS31FL3731 will let you get back to that classic LED matrix look, with a nice upgrade! This I2C LED driver chip has
the ability to PWM each individual LED in a 16x9 grid so you can have beautiful LED lighting effects, without a lot of
pin twiddling. Simply tell the chip which LED on the grid you want lit, and what brightness and it's all taken care of for
you.
